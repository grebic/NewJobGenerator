# NewJobGenerator
I made this button for accounting so that when a project manager requests a new job in smartsheet, accounting clicks the button once a job number is assigned and it fills out the pdf paperwork, creates the file structure in the job folder on our server, appropriately names the purchase order log and adds the po log file path to the job database so that other programs (like the PurchaseOrderCreator) can use that data.
